      <p class="fifth-text">When I was 5 years old my dad purchased our first computer for the household. This was back
        when floppy disks and brick phones were all the craze. From a young age I was exposed to the intricacies of
        computing and quickly learnt how to use a keyboard and mouse. By the time I was 8 I had my very own email
        account - 1ce_AnJeWeL@hotmail.com. Yes, I was that kind of 8 year old.
        <br>
        <br>
        <!-- I remember learning about Microsoft
        Word’s ability to copy and paste text and used this to my full advantage during grade 4 dictation when we had to
        write out the same 20 words 5 times. I was so proud of my new discovery as I would never have to write these
        boring words over and over again. However, my teacher wasn’t impressed, she quickly told me that she knew how
        copy/paste works and that I couldn’t take shortcuts in dictation.
        <br>
        <br> -->
        From a young age I was always curious to know how computers and the internet worked, with fond memories of my
        father telling me that computers are the future, and exposing me to various software and the internet at a young
        age. I always enjoyed computers but I never thought that it was a field females aspired to work in as my mother
        was a nurse and it was only my dad and older brother who worked in the IT industry.
        <br>
        <br>
        It was only until recently when I pushed myself out of my comfort zone and steered myself towards a career in IT
        that I realised what I was truly passionate about. I love learning how to make things work and then applying
        that knowledge to create something unique and inspirational. I believe that all of my experiences from nutrition
        to marketing have really pushed me towards where I am today - a student at Coder Academy aspiring to be a web
        developer.
        <br>
        <br>
        I believe that the most important resource we have is time, and technology today has the power to give us all
        more time to spend on things that are important to us, such as enjoying the company of family and friends. I am
        passionate about creating something new that takes the workload off the user and creates automated processes to
        ensure that they have the ability to spend more time on what’s important to them. </p>
