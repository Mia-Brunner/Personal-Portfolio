### Purpose 

The purpose of this assignment is to create a portfolio in the form of a website that can be used as a resource for potential employers during my job application process in the tech industry. This Portfolio provides a reference of my skills as a web developer, along with my work and study history. Unlike a generic resume, this portfolio will be able to portray my personality and interests through my choice of colours, aesthetics and styling throughout the website. This portfolio will also convey my current skills in creating a responsive website by using the tech stack of HTML and CSS. 

### Features/Functionality
##### 1. Responsive navigation using the 'burger' style drop-down menu
A responsive navigation menu was created to ensure ease of accessibility for smaller screens including tablets and phones. This was created using a media query for screens that are below the max width of 780px. This ensures that a burger style drop down menu will be created to adjust for both tablet and phone sizes. 
##### 2. Use of animations
I have applied the use of animations on both home page and about page. Blink-caret, a typewriter style animation was created for the welcome text in the home page which is also responsive to tablets and phones. 

##### Use of hover effects 
##### Fixed side bar, navigation menu, and footer 
##### Responsive website
