### Purpose 

The purpose of this assignment is to create a portfolio in the form of a website that can be used as a resource for potential employers during my job application process in the tech industry. This Portfolio provides a reference of my skills as a web developer, my work and study history. Unlike a generic resume, this portfolio will be able to portray my personality and interests through my choice of colours and styling throughout the website. This portfolio will also convey my current skills in creating a website by using the tech stack of HTML and CSS.
