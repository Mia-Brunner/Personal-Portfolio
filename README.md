### Purpose 

The purpose of this assignment is to create a portfolio in the form of a website that can be used as a resource for potential employers during my job application process in the tech industry. This Portfolio provides a reference of my skills as a web developer, along with my work and study history. Unlike a generic resume, this portfolio will be able to portray my personality and interests through my choice of colours, aesthetics and styling throughout the website. This portfolio will also convey my current skillsets in creating a responsive website by using the tech stack of HTML and CSS. 

### Features/Functionality
##### 1. Responsive navigation using the 'burger' style drop-down menu
A responsive navigation menu was created to ensure ease of accessibility for smaller screens including tablets and phones. This was created using a media query for screens that are below the max width of 780px. This ensures that a burger style drop down menu will be created to adjust for both tablet and phone sizes. 
##### 2. Use of animations
I have applied the use of animations on both the Home page and About page. Blink-caret, a typewriter style animation was created for the welcome text in the home page which is also responsive to tablets and phones. 
For the about page, the use of fading animations were applied by setting delays on the opacity of 5 seperate texts over a specified time-frame to create a cinematic experience over the animation box. 
##### 3. Use of hover effects 
Hover effects were used throughout all pages of the website as it has been applied on the navigation menu and the list of icons on the left side of the screen linking to socials such as GitHub, LinkedIn and also the contact page on the website. These features are available on every page due to its fixed/static design.

A hover effect was also applied to the 'enter' and 'next page' buttons allowing users to access the following pages. These are available on the Home page and the About page. 

Another hover effect was added to the images found on the Skills page. This allowed the user to hover over the existing images to access additional information about work and study history. 

##### 4. Responsive website 
Media queries were applied throughout all the pages of the website to allow accessibility for users who are on tablets or phones. 

##### 5. Branch for dark-mode 
A second branch was created for dark-mode allowing for a contrast in concept and aesthetics from the original website. This allows users to navigate through the same original layout with minor differences of colour and images to assist with the concept of dark-mode.

The use of low saturated colours such as light greys were applied to all texts and icons to ease the readability for users. If a high contrast colour was applied such as a white over a black background, it would be too sharp for the eyes making it more difficult to read for longer periods of time.

### Target Audience
- The main target audience for this website would be for future employers as this acts as an online resume for me to share my skills as a web developer. 
- Another audience that I am trying to target would be the assessors of this assessment. 
- The final target audience is current or aspiring web developers. Once this website is completed and finalised in the near future I would love to use this porfolio as a form of inspiration for other aspiring students who wish to create their own portfolio based website.
